## Overview
My name is Josh Marino and I am a master's student at Northwestern University in the MSR program (Master's in Robotics).

I graduated from Virginia Tech in 2014 with a BSME, and focused on robotics during my last two years. My senior design project was correctly articulating a bio-inspired robotic seagull. Also during my senior year in Advanced Mechatronics, we modified a RC car to drive autonomously using LIDAR frogm iRobot Roomba, amongst other sensors.

So far, as part of the MSR program, we attended a hack-a-thon in which we were introduced to ROS by creating a package to fire a USB rocket launcher at a red ball using OpenCV. My Fall 2014 quarter projects were (1) creating a 3R robot arm in Gazebo using ros_control with position and torque control, and (2) having Baxter stuff stockings for the holidays.
