## Overview
My name is Josh Marino and I am have a BSME from Virginia Tech and MSR from Northwestern University.

I graduated from Virginia Tech in 2014 with a BSME, and focused on robotics during my last two years. My senior design project was correctly articulating a bio-inspired robotic seagull. Also during my senior year in Advanced Mechatronics, we modified a RC car to drive autonomously using LIDAR frogm iRobot Roomba, amongst other sensors.

I recieved my Master's in Robotics (MSR) from Northwestern University in 2015. Our program volunteered for and attended IROS 2014 and ROSCON 2014 in Chicago before starting the school year. Also before starting classes, we completed a Hackathon in which we were introduced to Linux, ROS, and Python. Numerous projects were completed while obtaining my degree: 

1. Creating a 3R robot arm in Gazebo using ros_control with position and torque control (Fall 2014 - [link](http://joshmarino.github.io/portfolio/projects/15-2014-10-ros-control/))
2. Baxter stocking stuffer (Fall 2014 - [link](http://joshmarino.github.io/portfolio/projects/13-2014-12-Baxter-Stocking-Stuffer/))
3. Baxter dual-arm manipulation for passing a block from one hand to another (Winter 2015 - [link](http://joshmarino.github.io/portfolio/projects/12-2015-01-Baxter-Dual-Arm-Manipulation/))
4. Droplet manipulation by sustaining droplet above a vertically vibrating liquid using the PPOD (Spring & Summer 2015 - [link](http://joshmarino.github.io/portfolio/projects/11-2015-05-Droplet-Manipulation/))
