# Overview
We modified the 2R robot arm from [RRBot repo](https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_demos) to add a third link, making it a RRRBot. 

### RViz was used to visualize the RRRBot
RViz was used throughout to visualize the RRRBot. More specifically, the camera feed and Hokuyo laser scanner map attached at the end-effector were monitored while using ros_control.

### Gazebo was used with ros_control for position control
Gazebo was then used with ros_control to control the end-effector link to a desired trajectory. A position controller was used to accomplish this using PID control. Each link was commanded to follow a sine movement.

### Torque control with added mass at end of third link
An extension was then modified to use ros_control with torque control. A simple example was performed to stabilize the RRRBot to an unstable position. Next, we used torque control to maintain an unstable position while adding a mass (30% mass of third link) to the end-effector.
